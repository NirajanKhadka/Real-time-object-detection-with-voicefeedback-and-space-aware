# Real-Time Object Recognition with Voice Feedback 🎥🔊

Empowering visually impaired users with real-time object recognition and audio feedback through a web interface. 🚀

## Overview 🌍
This project uses **YOLOv4-tiny** to identify objects in real-time, providing spoken descriptions of objects and their locations via **Google Text-to-Speech**. The application is accessible through a local web interface. Currently, it provides voice feedback in **English**, but can be extended to other languages. 🌐

## Features ✨
- **Real-Time Object Detection** 🧠: Fast, accurate object recognition using **YOLOv4-tiny**.
- **Voice Feedback** 🗣️: Descriptions of detected objects spoken aloud (Currently supports **English**; other languages can be added).
- **Web Interface** 🌐: Accessible through a local web browser.
- **Extendable Language Support** 🌏: Audio feedback in **English**; can be modified to support additional languages.

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **YOLOv4-tiny** - for object detection
- **OpenCV** - for webcam access
- **gTTS** - for text-to-speech
- **Flask** - for local web server
